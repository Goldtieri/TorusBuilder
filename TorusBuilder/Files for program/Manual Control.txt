By enabling manual control, you will no longer be able to use the buttons,
except for the zoom buttons and the buttons for moving the shape along the axes. 
To control a 3d model, all you need is - 
1) hover the mouse cursor over the shape
2) press and hold the left mouse button
3) using the cursor movement to rotate the shape
You will be forced to rotate the figure yourself with the mouse!

The program has a built-in function of automatic rotation of the model, which can be carried out both 
on each individual coordinate axis and on all axes at once. It should be noted that you cannot use the 
rotation buttons when auto-rotation is enabled! In any case, you will definitely like it!
